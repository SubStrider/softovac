        p.lead
          | Of the many invented remedies to the far-reaching impact of indigestion among young Indian masses, there hung around a vacuum untended. Scientists at Lupin developed Softovac centrally aiming for optimal bowel movement with a non-habit forming, synergistic organic bowel regulating medicine. Softovac enables improved digestion, stimulates effective elimination of bodyâ€™s waste products, and delivers effective relief on consistent intake.
